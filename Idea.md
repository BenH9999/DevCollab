# DevCollab – Real-Time Collaborative Editor

## Concept

Build a web-based platform where multiple users can **edit documents or code simultaneously in real time**. Think of it as a mini Google Docs (or collaborative code editor) that supports smooth merge of concurrent edits. This project is perfect to showcase your ability to handle real-time communication, complex state management, and concurrency control on both frontend and backend.

## Key Features

- **Multi-User Live Editing:**  
  Allow multiple users to work on the same document simultaneously. Ensure that changes are instantly reflected across all user sessions.

- **Conflict Resolution & Versioning:**  
  Implement conflict resolution strategies (using CRDT or operational transforms) to merge edits seamlessly. Keep a version history that lets users roll back to previous document states.

- **User Presence & Permissions:**  
  Display which users are currently active on a document. Implement different user roles (e.g., viewer vs editor) and proper authentication for data security.

- **Real-Time Communication:**  
  Optionally integrate an in-document chat or comment system for collaborators to discuss changes instantly.

- **Notifications:**  
  Send notifications when collaborators join a document, make changes, or when there’s a potential conflict with simultaneous edits.

## Recommended Tech Stack

- **Frontend:**  
  - **React + TypeScript:** For building a robust and maintainable UI.
  - **TailwindCSS:** For fast and efficient styling.
  - **Rich Text/Code Editor Library:** Such as [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) or [Quill](https://quilljs.com/) to manage the text/code editing area.

- **Backend:**  
  - **Go:** Use Go to build a scalable backend server.
  - **WebSockets:** Implement with libraries like [Gorilla WebSocket](https://github.com/gorilla/websocket) for real-time communication.
  - **Database:**  
    - **PostgreSQL:** To store documents and edit history.
    - Alternatively, consider using **Firebase** or **Supabase** for integrated real-time features and authentication.

## Possible Free APIs/Integrations

- **Collaborative Editing Libraries:**  
  - **Y.js** or **ShareDB** – Open-source libraries for managing real-time collaborative editing.

- **Real-Time Messaging Services:**  
  - **Pusher or Ably** – Use their free tiers if you prefer a managed service for WebSocket connections.

- **User Avatar Integration:**  
  - **Gravatar or DiceBear API** – To display user avatars without building a custom image upload solution.

- **Authentication Providers:**  
  - **OAuth providers (GitHub, Google):** For easy user authentication.

## Why This Project is Valuable

DevCollab is an ambitious project that not only challenges you with the intricacies of real-time collaboration but also allows you to showcase robust frontend and backend integration. By handling live data synchronization, conflict resolution, and secure user interactions, you'll build a tool that stands out in your portfolio and impresses potential employers with its real-world applicability.
